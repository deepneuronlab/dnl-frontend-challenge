#Suggestions

- Using different years in balance as a key should be re-considered (UI change, nested properties maybe)


- Editing a company can be in an inline mode for the table itself without having a dialog


- Toaster management for all request handles


- Using only one FormDialog component to update and add depending on a flag called mode 







#Notes

- I have not changed the original structure about using years as keys in each company element, left that as a discussion point.


- Crud documentation is written in a way that it has a validation for the payload on the back-end side so no investigation is written for that matter.


- Company id is created via uuid but normally I would expect an ID creation on the back-end side.
